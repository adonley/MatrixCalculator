MatrixCalculator
================

A online matrix calculator to help people understand matrix operations, factoring, and their uses. The idea is to make a user friendly storage and operation set that can be understood upon entering the site. Later, this system will become distributed and will handle large matrices over a small cluster, and will output matrices in different formats.
